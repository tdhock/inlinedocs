** Installation

As of 3 June 2014, inlinedocs from R-Forge is deprecated (please do
not use it). Please instead install from CRAN or this GitHub
repository,

#+BEGIN_SRC R
  install.packages("inlinedocs")

  if(!requireNamespace("remotes"))install.packages("remotes")
  remotes::install_github("tdhock/inlinedocs")
#+END_SRC

** Write documentation in comments

See [[http://inlinedocs.r-forge.r-project.org/][the R-Forge page]] for a summary of the kinds of comments that are
recognized as documentation by the default inlinedocs Parser Functions.

** Convert comments to documentation

Read comments in =pkg/R/*.R= files, then generate =pkg/man/*.Rd= files:

#+BEGIN_SRC R
inlinedocs::package.skeleton.dx("path/to/your/pkg")
#+END_SRC

** Write your own Parser Function to extend inlinedocs

Don't like the default syntax? Want to add a new feature? You can
write your own Parser Functions that take your code/comments from *.R
files as input, and return documentation as output. 
Please read [[https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v054i06][the JSS paper]] for an overview of how this works, and see
[[file:inst/testfiles/alternate.R]] for an example.
