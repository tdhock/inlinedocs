\description{Create a fake package environment in a way that keeps S4 working (so
there is a .packageName) and also conforms to byte-code interpreter
requirements on environment structure, particularly ensuring that the
created environment is a namespace.  A similar procedure (with the
exception of not deleting objects) is now in testthat (test_pkg_env).}
