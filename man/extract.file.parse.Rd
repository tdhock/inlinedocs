\title{File content analysis}
\description{Using the base \code{parse} function, analyse the file to link
preceding "\code{\link{prefix}}" comments to each active chunk. Those comments form
the default description for that chunk. The analysis also looks for
S4 class "setClass" calls and R.oo setConstructorS3 and R.methodsS3::setMethodS3
calls in order to link the documentation of those properly.}
\usage{extract.file.parse(code)}
\arguments{
  \item{code}{Lines of R source code in a character vector - note that any
nested \code{source} statements are \emph{ignored} when scanning
for class definitions.}
}
\details{If the definition chunk does not contain a
description, any immediately preceding sequence consecutive
"\code{\link{prefix}}" lines will be used instead.

Class and method definitions can take several forms,
determined by expression type: \describe{
\item{assignment (<-)}{Ordinary assignment of value/function;}
\item{setClass}{Definition of S4 class;}
\item{setConstructorS3}{Definition of S3 class using R.oo package;}
\item{R.methodsS3::setMethodS3}{Definition of method for S3 class using R.oo package.}}
Additionally, the value may be a name of a function defined elsewhere,
in which case the documentation should be copied from that other definition.
This is handled using the concept of documentation links.

The \code{R.methodsS3::setMethodS3} calls introduce additional
complexity: they will define an additional S3 generic (which
needs documentation to avoid warnings at package build time)
unless one already exists. This also is handled by "linking"
documentation. A previously unseen generic is linked to the
first defining instances, subsequent definitions of that generic
also link back to the first defining instance.}
\value{Returns an invisible list of .DocLink objects.}
